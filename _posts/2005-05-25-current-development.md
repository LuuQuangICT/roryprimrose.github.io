For the last month, I have been taking a break from developing the skinning engine. Instead of working on the skinning engine, I have been putting my focus into developing a feed reader application as I am not happy with the readers currently available. There has always been a particular feature or lack thereof that I didn't like, and my current one has become unreliable. I hope to have a Beta version available sometime in the next month or two depending on the time available.  
  
On a similar note, I have fixed a bug in the RSS feeds on the site where there were three non-standard characters being put at the start of the feeds.
