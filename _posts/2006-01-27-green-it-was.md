<p>For several months at the end of last year, Canberra has received more rain than we have probably seen for years. The whole area has been brown due to a lengthy drought for many years. While most of the surrounding state is still drought declared, Canberra has been able to make something of the rain it has been given.</p> <p><a href="/blogfiles/WindowsLiveWriter/Greenitwas_121CC/20051112-141401.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="430" alt="20051112-141401" src="/blogfiles/WindowsLiveWriter/Greenitwas_121CC/20051112-141401_thumb.jpg" width="644" border="0"></a>   <p>Unfortunately, Canberra is all brown again. Pity, it was quite beautiful when everything was green.</p>
