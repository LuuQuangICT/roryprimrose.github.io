Since I got an XBox360 after TechEd, I haven't been able to stream videos or live TV from my MCE 2005 box. As soon as I tried, it would give a second of sound and then MCE would lock up. From all the research that I did on the net, I could only find a couple of references to this happening to other people. The culprit seemed to be the network card.

It's hard to believe that a network card could be causing this problem. It seemed to be more and more likely though as the machine also locked up five times when I was transferring several gigabytes across the NIC one night.

The onboard NIC in the motherboard didn't work for me prior to this because it couldn't talk properly to my router. I had installed a spare PCI NIC that I had back from my BigPond ADSL (no link deserved :P) days.

With my research into the MCE issues, the solution seemed to be to get an updated set of drivers for the NIC. I found out that my 'no name' NIC only had drivers back to something like 2003 or 2002. Ok, so no good on that front.

Yesterday, I was out pram shopping and happened to end up next to [Harris Technology][0] (no seriously, it wasn't planned!). $30 later got me a [Netgear GA3111][1]. I wasn't holding a lot of hope on this as a solution, but I was very pleased when this new NIC worked with MCE straight away. Sweet!

Oh, and I also picked up a [Valco TriMode][2] from [Baby Wombats][3] for a good deal.
