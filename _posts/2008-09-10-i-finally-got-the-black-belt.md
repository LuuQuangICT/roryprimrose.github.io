<p>It has taken a lot longer than expected, but I finally got my black belt this weekend. </p> <p><a href="/files/WindowsLiveWriter/Ifinallygottheblackbelt_86/20080906-050249.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="484" alt="Black belt" src="/files/WindowsLiveWriter/Ifinallygottheblackbelt_86/20080906-050249_thumb.jpg" width="323" border="0"></a> </p> <p>It has been a long road, but I am glad I have finally hit this mark. Unfortunately I now need to stop doing Taekwondo because of how my joints are going. It's been a fun ride and I will miss it.</p>
