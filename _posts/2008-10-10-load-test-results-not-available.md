<p>I have received an email report from TFS for a nightly team build that I have set up. The build ran the unit tests successfully, but failed on some of the load tests. The warning provided is <em>Warning: only a part of test result was loaded because test type implementation is not available</em>. If I try to open the test, I get a message box saying <em>There are no Test Result Details available</em>.</p>  <p>Google fails to provide any insight into this error.</p>  <p><a href="//files/WindowsLiveWriter/Loadtestresultsnotavailable_81CA/LoadTestResultsError_2.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="106" alt="Load Test Results Error" src="//files/WindowsLiveWriter/Loadtestresultsnotavailable_81CA/LoadTestResultsError_thumb.jpg" width="644" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Anyone come across this before?</p>
