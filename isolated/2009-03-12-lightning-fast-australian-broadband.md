I&#39;ve been on ADSL2+ for a few years now. Having a possible maximum speed of 24Gb is nice, but the actual floats between 5-7Gb being 3.5km from the exchange. That&#39;s not great, but is fast enough for general net usage. Tonight however, surfing the net has been slow. Really really slow. So slow in fact, that <a href="http://www.speedtest.net">www.speedtest.net</a> tells me this.

In the test before this one, the upload speed was actually a tad faster than the download speed. Did someone say broadband???

Yep, I&#39;m glad that broadband in this country is so fast. My sarcasm drips all the way from this post to <a href="http://www.epitiro.com/news/australian-broadband-underachieving.html" target="_blank">this article</a>. Broadband in this country is a disgrace which is a real shame.
